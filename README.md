# Student Grading System (CLI – Python)

A command-line based Student Grading System built using Python.
This project allows users to manage student records, calculate grades, search and update data, and analyze class performance through toppers.

This is a menu-driven CLI application designed to strengthen core Python concepts such as dictionaries, functions, loops, validation, and program flow.

## Features Implemented
✅ Student Management (CRUD)

Add Student

Roll number validation

Marks validation (0–100)

Automatic total, percentage, and grade calculation

Delete Student

Update Student

Update name

Update marks

Automatic recalculation after updates

Show All Students

Search Functionality

Search student by:

Roll Number

Name (case-insensitive)

📊 Academic Analytics

Class Topper

Displays student with highest total marks

Subject Topper

Finds topper in:
Maths
OOP
DSA


Grading System

Grades are assigned automatically based on percentage:

Percentage	Grade
≥ 95	    A++
90 – 94	    A
80 – 89	    B
70 – 79	    C
60 – 69	    D
< 60	    F

## Concepts Used:

Dictionaries (nested)

Functions

Loops

Conditional logic

Input validation

Menu-driven CLI design

## Current Status

✔Core student management complete

✔Search and update functionality complete

✔Class topper & subject topper implemented

Class result summary (grade distribution, averages) – planned

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, the following Python skills were practiced:

Data modeling with dictionaries

Writing modular functions

Handling user input safely

Implementing real-world logic

Building a complete CLI application
